-- Complexity: Medium (Pending Completion)
-- Estimated Cost: TBD | Bytes Scanned: TBD
-- 
-- Status: PENDING REVIEW
-- Reason: Query is marked as TODO in original document - incomplete/needs work
-- 
-- Description:
-- This query needs to be completed. The goal is to select all unique CodeSequence
-- tuples as strings from DICOM objects. This is challenging because code sequences
-- can be hiding behind different sequence attributes throughout the DICOM model.
-- 
-- Note: Requires investigation into appropriate approach and implementation.
